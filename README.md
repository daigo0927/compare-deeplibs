# Compare popular Deep Learning libraries
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- PyTorch
- Chainer

Compare popular deep learning libraries by their forward-backward speed.

**In my experiment, TensorFlow-v2 is the currently fastest library !**

Note that data-reading takes long time compared to forward-backword in a small model.

There may be more smart-style training script, really glad to see that. Best regards!

## Main environment
- python 3.6
- tensorflow-gpu 1.14.0/2.0.0rc
- torch 1.2.0
  - torchvision 0.4.0
- chainer 6.3.0
  
## Experiment
Try to run the compare.ipynb in Google colaboratory.
